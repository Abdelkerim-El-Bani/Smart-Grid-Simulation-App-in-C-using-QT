# Smart Grid – C++ & Qt Project

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a **Smart Grid** where users can manage power plants, consumers, and their connections.  
It provides a simple yet effective **Qt-based interface** to visualize and interact with the grid.

## ⚡ Features
- Manage **Centrales (power plants)**, **Gouvernerats (regions)**, and **Sectors**.
- Add, modify, delete, and search for entities.
- Simulate **production vs. consumption balance** based on:
  - Season
  - Weather conditions
  - Type of zone (industrial / residential)
- Resource management system to match demand and production.
- Liaison management (linking centrales with gouvernerats).
- Simple UI with **Qt** for easy interaction.
- Developed and tested on **Linux Ubuntu**.
- Custom **Makefiles** included for building and running.
